Developed by: Ross Sakowski, PharmD + Astra (AI Partner)

================================================================================
SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
================================================================================

Current State: Medication Reconciliation Challenges

• 50% of medication errors occur during care transitions
• Patients often forget or misreport home medications  
• Pharmacy staff spend excessive time on phone calls verifying meds
• Delayed medication reconciliation impacts patient safety
• No secure, efficient way for patients to transmit medication lists

RESULT: Delayed care, potential adverse drug events, frustrated staff

================================================================================
SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION
================================================================================

MedRec Secure Intake

A zero-storage, HIPAA-ready system that allows patients to securely submit their home medication lists directly to pharmacy.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Staff generates unique QR code for patient
2. Patient scans QR → fills secure form (medications, pharmacy info)
3. Data is emailed directly to pharmacy
4. ZERO DATA STORAGE — information exists only in the email

KEY INNOVATION: No database, no persistent storage, maximum privacy

================================================================================
SLIDE 4: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

Technical Stack:

Patient Device → Vercel Cloud (Serverless) → Resend Email API → Pharmacy Inbox

SECURITY FEATURES:
• End-to-end HTTPS encryption
• Time-limited QR codes (24-hour expiration)
• Rate limiting (prevents spam)
• Input sanitization (prevents injection attacks)
• No PHI in logs or databases
• CORS protection

INFRASTRUCTURE:
• Frontend: Static HTML/CSS/JS (GitHub + Vercel)
• Backend: Serverless functions (Vercel)
• Email: Resend API (HIPAA-compliant infrastructure)

================================================================================
SLIDE 5: USER EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

FOR STAFF (30 seconds):
1. Open staff portal
2. Enter patient initials/room number
3. Generate & print QR code

FOR PATIENTS (3-5 minutes):
1. Scan QR with phone camera
2. Choose: Email photo of med list OR fill form
3. Enter home medications
4. Submit → immediate confirmation

DECISION TREE BUILT IN:
• Patients with photos/docs → Email directly to pharmacy
• Patients without → Fill structured form

================================================================================
SLIDE 6: DATA COLLECTED
================================================================================

PATIENT INFORMATION:
• Patient initials OR room number
• Date of birth
• Phone number (optional)

HOME PHARMACY:
• Pharmacy name
• Address
• Phone number

HOME MEDICATIONS:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
• Free-text notes (allergies, conditions, instructions)

================================================================================
SLIDE 7: SECURITY & PRIVACY
================================================================================

ZERO-STORAGE ARCHITECTURE:
✓ No database
